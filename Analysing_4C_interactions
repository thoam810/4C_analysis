#Analyzing 4C interactions
#Creating a 4C-ker object: 
#A 4C-ker object can be created using exiting data frames loaded in R (create4CkerObjectFromDFs)
#It will also check if the samples pass QC criteria and generate a stats file. 
#To pass QC samples must have > than 1 million reads, > than 40% of reads on the cis chromosome and > 40% coverage in the 200kb region around the bait for 4bp cutter and 2MB for 6bp cutters. 
#The arguments for the function are as follows:

#files/dfs: path to files or character string of the names of the data.frame variables
#bait_chr: chromosome name of bait location
#bait_coord: chromosomal coordinate of bait primer
#primary_enz: sequence of primary restriction enzyme
#samples: names of samples for all files
#conditions: names of conditions being analyzed (min of 1)
#replicates: number of replicates for each condition
#species: code for species (Mouse=mm, Human=hs)
#output_dir: path to directory where all output files will be saved
#enz_file: data.frame containing RE fragments

#For the RE fragments you can use the file generated from the reduced_genome script

#This file will give you an initial QC of all the files (> than 1 million reads, > than 40% of reads on the cis chromosome and > 40% coverage in the 200kb region around the bait for 4bp cutter and 2MB for 6bp cutters.)
#from here samples can be reinputted based on QC
# RUNX1 +24 DpnII example (WT PMA 12h replicate 2 was not included as it did not pass QC)

#To analayse cis interactions
#4C-ker recommends a k=10 for all experiments. However as the adaptive window build uses overlapping windows, consecutive windows that are detected as highly interacting can be stitched to form a ‘domain’ of high interaction with the bait. When k=10 the consequtive windows were too large to identify the regions of highest interaction , so k=5 was chosen.
