#Differential analysis is done between two conditions on the windows that are interacting with the bait in at least 2 condition. 
#This analysis only works for nearbait and cis interactions. 
#A plot of significant interactions was generated and a BED file of significantly different domains was saved in the output directory. 
#All run as per https://github.com/rr1859/R.4Cker
#The arguments for the function are as follows:
#obj: 4CkerObject created for analysis Analysing_4C_interactions
#norm_counts_avg: Average counts of replicates for each condition per window
#windows: Raw counts per window for each sample
#conditions: Conditions to compare - only two conditions for each comparison (same names as Analysing_4C_interactions)
#region: Region for analysis. "nearbait" or "cis"
#coordinates: Coordinates for a more focused analysis. example: coordinates=c(41e6,42e6)
#pval: p-value cut off for DESeq2 analysis. Recommended values are 0.01,0.05 or 0.1. If given p-value fails, the function will try higher values upto 0.1

#These were carried out for nearbait and cis
